                            COMPILING C++ AND RUNNING IT
===============================================================================

g++ myCppProgram.cpp

A program called a.out or a.exe should be created. You can run it by typing in
./a.out or ./a.exe

If you're using windows, you can compile C++ by
   1) Install Linux Subsystem for Windows
      http://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/
        - Once install run the following commands
	   sudo apt update
	   sudo apt upgrade
	   sudo apt install build-essential
	- If you want to use git through bash rather than windows
	   sudo apt install git
   2) Using Cygwin (Mimics Linux Commands on Windows)
      https://cygwin.com/install.html

If you're using a Mac
   1) Install XCode

                           C++ STANDARD LIBRARY
==============================================================================

This is a great way to find many of the functionalities and data structures
built directly into C++ such as LinkedList, ArrayList, PriorityQueue, Hash
Map, etc. You can find most information of these libraries on the web.

                                      SAMPLE CODE
===============================================================================

#include <iostream>     // Uses the input/output standard library of C++

// Main takes in an int argc (number of arguments from command line) and a
// character array, holding each argument.
int main( int argc, char ** [] ) {

  // Print out Hello world message
  //   std::cout means we are using the "cout" functionalities of the "std"
  //   (C++ standard) library. "cout" means to print to standard output. endl
  //   means to insert a new line
  std::cout << "First Last Here, Hello World!" << std::endl;

  // return 0 for successful execution
  return 0;
}
