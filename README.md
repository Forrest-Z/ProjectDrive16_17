# UCSD Project Drive 2016/17 *- [ WORK IN PROGRESS ]*

Project Drive is a year long student run project hosted and funded by the IEEE Branch of the
University of California, San Diego. The premise of this project is to build a 1/10 scale fully
autonomous RC vehicle that will compete in this year's 2017
[SparkFun Classic AVC](https://avc.sparkfun.com/2016/rules#AVC) Competition.

For this year's competition, the team will be focusing on designing and implementing a vehicle that
could explore and map out any given flat environment. We therefore will be building our own 360
LIDAR system which would be used for spatial mapping and localization in conjunction with ROS's Hector
SLAM. We will also be working with OpenCV to implement various image recognition softwares that will
further allow our vehicle to interact with its environment by picking up both obstacles and goal
points scattered throughout the race course.

## Progress Update

#### Brief Update
As of March 31st, 2017, the team currently has spatial mapping and localization up and running while our
360 LIDAR system is stationary. We have fully completed designing and testing our power system that will
ensure power is delivered to all the components of our vehicle in a safe and reliable manner.
Our next step would be to attach the power system  to our vehicle and begin testing spatial
mapping while the 360 LIDAR system is in motion.

#### 360 LIDAR System And SLAM
We are currently using the TeraRanger One as the distance sensor for our 360 LIDAR system. The middle
and right image shows the resulting map we received from running our sensor at 300 Hz vs 1000 Hz.

#### Website
At the present time, our primary focus is to complete the project in time for the competition in
September 2017. However, we are documenting all our design process in detail and are excited to share
it with you in a comprehensive website in the future. Stay tune!
